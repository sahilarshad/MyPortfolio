        <h3>Full Stack Developer Intern</h3>
        <p><em>Sharp Software Development India Pvt. Ltd. (Sep 2023 â€“ Dec 2023)</em></p>
        <p>
          During my internship, I contributed to the development of a web-based platform for corporate device management.
          I worked closely with a team to design scalable features, optimize database performance, and implement responsive
          user interfaces. This experience strengthened my understanding of full stack development and agile methodologies.
